# --- PREPROCESSING
preprocessing:
  
  denoise_model: normal  # normal, normal_periodic, gamma_periodic
  denoise_method: lowpass  # lowpass, polyfit, rollav/rolling_average
  # For the noise object
  denoise_coef: 0.0  # Noise coefficient
  denoise_nperiods: 7  # (for normal_periodic) Period of weekly patterns in days

  # For lowpass/polyfit method
  denoise_cutoff: 0.350
  denoise_order: 2
  denoise_seed: 10
  
  # Negative artifacts
  negative_method: shift  # (clamp, shift) Method to deal with negative incidence values after filtering

# --- R(t) ESTIMATION (MCMC)
rt_estimation:
#  method: mcmc  # Only mcmc for now
  engine: gamma     # c, numba, gamma
  seed: 10
  roi_len: 80  # In granular periods. Must be bigger than nperiods_past + i_t0. Blank to use main_roi (in weeks).

  # Data scaling
  scale_method: data_pwr  # const, data_pwr, pop_pwr?
  scale_roi_len: 30   # ["data_pwr" method] – How many granular periods of past incidence to consider for the scaling factor.
  scale_power: 1.0   # Pwr method: scaled = (ref / avg) ** power. Values lower than 1 add uncertainty to lower incidence and remove from higher.
  scale_ref_inc: 70  # 65  # Reference incidence for scaling ["data_pwr" method]. Larger => more confident
  scale_ref_pop: 12000  # Reference population for scaling ["pop_pwr" method]

  # Drift synth-reconstruction parameters
#  drift_pop_coef: 50  #20.0e+3  # Coefficient of the drift term (population-normalized) ["drift_pop"]. Drift = coef / pop * c(t). Higher = more drift.
